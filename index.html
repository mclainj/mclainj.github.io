	<h1>Portfolio Under Construction</h1>
	<p>My name is McLain Johnson, and I'm a Computer Science student at <em>Texas A&M University</em>. 
		It is my goal to work on technologically innovative and fun games. Toward that end, I'm currently concentrating my degree on courses that should prove useful in the industry,
		, as well as taking a Unity game development course online. I've enjoyed developing games in my free time, and I look forward to sharing my experiences here in the future. 
		I apologize for the lack of content at the moment, as I'm currently working on deploying my portfolio. Please check back for an update soon! Thanks for your understanding.</p>
